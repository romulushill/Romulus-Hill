## Who Am I? 💁

A dedicated and active developer of all things computers, I work with a range of languages and take a host of approaches towards my programming. I'm primarily a developer working in Python and NodeJS, but I have a considerable amount of experience working with web development in all its forms, from PHP and SQL🐬 to HTML and CSS, even working the backend with NGINX and Apache🪶. Professional experience is something I am yet to increase upon, but despite this, I work tirelessly on a range of my own digital services.
